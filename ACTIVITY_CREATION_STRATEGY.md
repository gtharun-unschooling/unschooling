```

#### **2. Category Analysis**
```
FOR EACH Category:
    - Review category description and purpose
    - Identify typical skills developed
    - Consider appropriate materials and tools
    - Plan activity progression from simple to complex
    - Ensure activities match category goals
```

#### **3. Developmental Appropriateness Check**
```
FOR EACH Activity:
    - Verify skills required match age capabilities
    - Ensure materials are age-safe
    - Check time requirements match attention spans
    - Validate supervision levels are appropriate
    - Confirm learning objectives are achievable
```
