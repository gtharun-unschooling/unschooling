# 🚀 ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## **FOR LIVE CUSTOMERS - SAFE DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW**

### **🔥 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (DO THIS NOW)**

#### **1. Current Cookie Consent Fix**
Your cookie consent is now minimized and ready to deploy:

```bash
# You're currently on development branch with the fix
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Minimize cookie consent to smallest possible size"

# Deploy to production safely
git checkout main
git merge development
./deploy-production.sh
```

### **📋 DAILY WORKFLOW**

#### **For Small Changes (Cookie Consent, UI fixes):**
```bash
# 1. Work on development branch
git checkout development
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Description of changes"

# 2. Test locally
npm start
# Test thoroughly

# 3. Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge development
./deploy-production.sh
```

#### **For Major Features:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout development
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# 2. Develop and test
# Make changes, test locally

# 3. Merge to development
git checkout development
git merge feature/new-feature-name

# 4. Test on staging (if available)
git checkout staging
git merge development
./deploy-staging.sh

# 5. Deploy to production after staging tests
git checkout main
git merge staging
./deploy-production.sh
```

#### **For Emergency Fixes:**
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue

# 2. Fix the issue
# Make minimal changes to fix the problem

# 3. Test and deploy immediately
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-issue
./deploy-production.sh
```

### **🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

#### **If Something Goes Wrong:**
```bash
# Immediate rollback
./rollback-production.sh
```

#### **If You Need to Revert Specific Changes:**
```bash
# Find the problematic commit
git log --oneline

# Revert specific commit
git revert COMMIT_HASH
./deploy-production.sh
```

### **📊 BRANCH STRATEGY**

```
main (production)           ← Live customer site
├── staging                 ← Testing environment  
├── development            ← Active development
├── backup-*              ← Automatic backups
└── feature-*             ← Feature development
```

### **🔒 SAFETY CHECKLIST**

Before ANY production deployment:

- [ ] ✅ Code tested locally
- [ ] ✅ All changes committed
- [ ] ✅ On correct branch (main)
- [ ] ✅ No uncommitted changes
- [ ] ✅ Backup created (automatic)
- [ ] ✅ Rollback plan ready

### **📱 CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION**
